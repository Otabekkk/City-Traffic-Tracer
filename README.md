# 🚦 Smart Traffic Simulator for Bishkek

A platform for testing traffic light configurations
using real microscopic traffic simulation (SUMO).

![Demo Backend](screenshots/1.png)

## 🚀 Problem
Traffic light changes are usually applied directly in real cities,
which is risky and expensive.

## 💡 Solution
We provide a platform where traffic engineers can:
- configure traffic light phases
- simulate traffic behavior
- compare metrics before deployment

## ▶ Simulation Playback

Playback helps understand *why* a configuration works better.

## 🏙 Focus
The project is focused on **Bishkek**, but can be adapted to any city.

## 👥 Team
Otabek - Backend 
Bekmyrza - Simulation
Asel - Frontend / UX
Yana, Sanjar - Pitch / Design
